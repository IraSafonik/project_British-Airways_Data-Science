# About company 
British Airways (BA) is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom (UK). Every day, thousands of BA flights arrive to and depart from the UK, carrying customers across the world. Whether itâ€™s for holidays, work or any other reason, the end-to-end process of scheduling, planning, boarding, fuelling, transporting, landing, and continuously running flights on time, efficiently and with top-class customer service is a huge task with many highly important responsibilities.

## Task 1:
As a data scientist at British Airways (BA), the primary task is to scrape and collect customer feedback from a third-party source, specifically focusing on reviews about the airline itself.
