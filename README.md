# About company 
British Airways (BA) is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom (UK). Every day, thousands of BA flights arrive to and depart from the UK, carrying customers across the world. Whether itâ€™s for holidays, work or any other reason, the end-to-end process of scheduling, planning, boarding, fuelling, transporting, landing, and continuously running flights on time, efficiently and with top-class customer service is a huge task with many highly important responsibilities.

## Task 1:
As a data scientist at British Airways (BA), the primary task is to scrape and collect customer feedback from a third-party source, specifically focusing on reviews about the airline itself. The data collected will then be analyzed to uncover insights that can influence key business decisions, reduce costs, and increase revenue.

1. Scrape Data from the Web:
- Utilize web scraping techniques to collect review data from Skytrax.
- Focus on reviews specifically about British Airways.
- Ensure thorough data collection to enhance the output of the analysis.
2. Analyse Data:
- Perform data cleaning to prepare the collected dataset for analysis.
- Apply analytical techniques such as topic modeling, sentiment analysis, or word clouds to extract insights from the data.
- Utilize Python for data analysis, but other tools can be used as well.
- Ensure that the data is stored in a "data" folder and the file path is appropriately mapped.
3. Present Insights:
- Summarize findings within a single PowerPoint slide for presentation at the next board meeting.
- Create visualizations and metrics to illustrate key insights derived from the analysis.
- Provide clear and concise explanations to quickly convey the key points from the analysis.

## Solution:
The project involves scraping customer feedback from Skytrax, focusing on British Airways reviews, and analyzing the data to uncover actionable insights. The following steps are undertaken:

1. Data Collection:
- Utilize Python and libraries such as BeautifulSoup and requests for web scraping.
- Collect review data from Skytrax, focusing on British Airways.
- Ensure comprehensive data collection to enhance the quality of analysis.
2. Data Analysis:
- Perform data cleaning to handle messy text data.
- Apply natural language processing techniques for analysis, including sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and word clouds.
- Utilize Python for analysis, leveraging libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, and scikit-learn.
3. Presentation of Insights:
- Summarize findings in a PowerPoint slide for presentation at the board meeting.
- Create visualizations such as bar charts, word clouds, and sentiment distributions to illustrate key insights.
- Provide clear and concise explanations of the analysis results to facilitate understanding by stakeholders.

Overall, the project aims to leverage customer feedback analysis to drive informed decision-making and enhance the customer experience at British Airways.
