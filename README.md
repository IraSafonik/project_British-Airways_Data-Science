# About company 
British Airways (BA) is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom (UK). Every day, thousands of BA flights arrive to and depart from the UK, carrying customers across the world. Whether it’s for holidays, work or any other reason, the end-to-end process of scheduling, planning, boarding, fuelling, transporting, landing, and continuously running flights on time, efficiently and with top-class customer service is a huge task with many highly important responsibilities.

## Task 1:
Task Description:
As a data scientist at British Airways (BA), the primary task is to scrape and collect customer feedback from a third-party source, specifically focusing on reviews about the airline itself. The data collected will then be analyzed to uncover insights that can influence key business decisions, reduce costs, and increase revenue.

Task Overview:
1. Scrape Data from Skytrax:
- Collect reviews specifically about British Airways.
- Ensure comprehensive data collection for insightful analysis.
2. Analyse Data:
- Perform data cleaning to prepare the collected dataset for analysis.
- Apply analytical techniques such as topic modeling, sentiment analysis, or word clouds to extract insights from the data.
- Utilize Python for data analysis, but other tools can be used as well.
3. Present Insights:
- Summarize findings within a single PowerPoint slide for presentation at the next board meeting.
- Create visualizations and metrics to illustrate key insights derived from the analysis.
- Provide clear and concise explanations to quickly convey the key points from the analysis.
